# Perudo
Perudo is an existing game designed by Richard Borg. You can find the game [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/45/perudo) on boardgamegeek. All the inspiration and knowledge I got is from the real game. What I am doing here is recreating the game for my own pleasure and practice on the pc in C++98. Everything is text based (for now at least) so don't expect a nice working game with fancy graphics.

# Instructions
Compile the program with ```make``` or ```make game``` to launch the game. A list of instructions is shown which will help you through to get started. You'll need at least two players with a maximum of five.
